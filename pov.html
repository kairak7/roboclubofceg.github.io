	    Persistence Of Vision is the phenomenon of the eye by which an image seen by our eye persists 
		for about 0.04s during which any other images that we see are merged together with this image. 
		This ability can be used to create an illusion of images/characters floating in the air, by 
		rapidly flashing a column of LEDs while moving the display in air. 
		Thus to make the display we have to do the following 
		1. Design a circuitry to control the flashing of LEDs in a LED column. 
		2. Program the circuit to flash in an appropriate pattern. 
		3. Synchronize the flashing with the motion of the display. 
		Pov is accomplished with the following: 
		•	500 rpm high torque motor
		•	NodeMcu 
		•	LEDS-12 
		•	200 ohm resistors
		•	7 amps battery 
		Firstly, POV is constructed on a rectangular mica sheet. Due to the connection uneasiness.
		Then we switched on to a circular mica sheet.The crank and the circular sheet are bolted together. 
		12 LEDs are soldered with resistors on the dot board.The arduino,the battery and the dot board 
		with LEDS were placed in such a manner the weight is equally distributed.The biggest problem 
		was the making of the hardware setup as the whole system had to be a light weight, evenly 
		balanced and yet a strong one. Even slight variation of centre of mass from the axle resulted 
		in large scale wobbling of the system. Here the distribution of weight tested our patience. 
		We went through number of trial and errors to get fine display. Then we displayed more other 
		names to check each character display.Next we switched to NODEMCU for memory expansion and wifi program. 
		We used thingspeak.com for generating API of cricket score from espn website. 
		ThingSpeak is an open source “Internet of Things” application and API to store and retrieve 
		data from things using HTTP over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. 
		After generating api using thingspeak.com we used node mcu to retrieve the data from the espn 
		link and the data was displayed using pov.

	After the completion of each second known using millis function second hand is shifted. Likewise minutes hand <br>
	is shifted. Millis function returns the number of milliseconds since the NODEMCU board began running the current <br>
	program. This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately 50 days.Then we displayed the number 12. <br>
	Thus the final pov clock consisted of an outer green rim with 12 as reference. <br>
